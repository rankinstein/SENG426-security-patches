					ACME’s POSEIDON® Technology
				</h4>
				<p>
					POSEIDON ® Technology is ACME’s standards-based and patented IoT security monitoring system that forms the 
					foundation of ACME’s product line. POSEIDON® is multiservice security platform designed to address the 
					versatility and ubiquity of IoT devices and networks. It is integrates several complementary services
					ranging monitoring and reporting, business intelligence, firewall, and a cryptographic key management 
					framework that answers the urgent need for information security, access management and complete recoverability 
					of digital assets. In today’s vastly networked world with digitalized applications such as Voice Over IP (VOIP), 
					Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP), and Virtual Private Networks (VPN), the need has never been greater 
					to identify authorized users, protect and control sensitive information 
					assets, and manage access to information, in compliance with privacy statutes and regulations.
				</p>
				<p>
					POSEIDON® technology, utilizing the constructive key management standard, protects information down to the object level. 
					It can secure any object from a field in a healthcare claim form—to a selected portion 
					of a Microsoft® Word Document—to an entire file of real-time, streaming digital media. 
					POSEIDON® is at the core of an advanced Role Based Access Control (RBAC) system that allows 
					secured information to be shared among groups of users, each group having different levels of access to the secured information. 
					POSEIDON® encrypts at the information level and manages information sharing relationships via cryptography. 
					It is well understood that network perimeter defenses (firewalls, anti-virus, etc.) must be supplemented with 
					the protection of the network content and ACME’s POSEIDON® products and solutions provide the protection of 
					the content to effectively supplement network defenses.
