                    <h1>ACME Security Systems Announces Mobile Client for Integrating SSL VPN Secure Access and Mobile Application Management</h1>
                    <hr>
                    <p>New MobaApp app enables secure access from tablets and smart phones and streamlines management of native, Web and remote desktop applications.</p>
                    <p>Cupertino, CA – October 4, 2016 – ACME Security Systems Ltd., today announces the availability of MobApp, its advanced SSL VPN client for mobile devices. MobApp is an innovative mobile app that extends ACME’s POSEIDON technology. Available for iOS and Android, MobApp provides secure mobile access for native, Web and remote desktop applications. In addition, its integrated enterprise app store streamlines the provisioning and management of users, applications and devices. </p>
                    <p>Available in conjunction with ACME’s physical and virtual POSEIDON Series secure access gateways, MobApp is ideal for securely addressing the growing demand for enterprise mobility and current trends toward bring your own device (BYOD). Using MobApp, IT can configure on-demand Layer-3 VPN connections for native business apps or leverage ACME’s POSEIDON SDK to enable VPN connections on a per-application basis. In addition, MobApp provides a secure portal and a secure browser where remote desktops and Web-based applications may be safely utilized on tablets and smartphones. </p>
                    <p>Leveraging MobApp’s integrated mobile application management capabilities, enterprises can manage and streamline the deployment of native and Web-based mobile applications to both personal and corporate-owned tablets and smartphones. In addition, businesses can ensure security for mission-critical applications in mobile environments through a combination of device-based identification, 2048-bit SSL encryption, advanced authentication, authorization and accounting (AAA), data containerization and remote wiping capabilities. </p>
                    <p>Needing anytime, anywhere access to documents, files, applications and email from any device, including newer-version mobile devices, the City of San Francisco was among the first ACME customers to adopt MobApp. After installing the freely available MobApp client on their iOS and Android-based devices, City employees experienced significant gains in productivity. Moreover, with the combination of the POSEIDON Series gateway and the MobApp client, the City gained a layered security approach that ensures sensitive information is protected from interception or inappropriate access.</p>
